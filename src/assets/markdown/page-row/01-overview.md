## Basic Structure

Each page of your UI will most likely have data structured in rows and columns. First you'll include the type of row you want, then include of that row will have the columns. The rows will add the correct padding that you need.

## Components

<br>

`Row`<br>
The most basic row that you can have. You'll normally use this with a 100% width column or two 50% width columns.

---

This will add a vertical border between two rows.
