## Usage

**Who should and shouldn't use Bubbles**

Bubbles is an opinionated component library build for Svelte Kit. It's has a specific structure and style that it follows. If the overall structure of it's layouts and components don't fit your needs, you're most likely better of using a more flexible component framework like Material UI, Tailwind, or writing your own.

Bubbles is mostly set up to construct dashboards NOT landing pages and marketing sites. It has lots of dashboard specific components like Sidebars and Tables that are usually overkill and/or are too restrictive for marketing sites.
