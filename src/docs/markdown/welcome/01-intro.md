## Usage

<br>

**Who should and shouldn't use Bubbles**

Bubbles is an opinionated component library build for Svelte Kit. So what is the point of this project? The goal is to allow for dashboards to be created very quickly with lots of standard components.

When you think of your typical dashboard with a sidebar on the left, some content in the center, and maybe some buttons in the top left corner as actions. Most data is displayed in tables of some kind.

If this is not the project you are envisioning, then this UI Kit is probably not the right option for you. In that case, I'll point you to some wonderful projects like Material UI and Tailwind which are better set up as an "all purpose" kit.

**What does Bubbles do that other don't**

Bubbles is set up to make working with data pretty easy. There are lots of helpful utilities that validate form data, add query parameters for filters on fetch requests, and force you to user a pretty minimalist design so the data remains highly readable. One neat features are the `Table` components which use a stacked row approach for better data density. It also has Stripe built in.
