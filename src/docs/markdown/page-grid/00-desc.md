## Description

This is an easy to use wrapper for CSS Grid with some transitions built in. If you need something more custom, you should just make your own grid.

This comes in two components, Grid and GridItem.

The Grid is the main component and will take accept properties to customize is responsiveness and layout. The GridItem is just a wrapper for each of your items which will give it some nice animations but is completely optional.
