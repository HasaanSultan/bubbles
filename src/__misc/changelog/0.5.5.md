**Added**

- When a `TableRow` component has an `href` and also includes an `IconButton` component, the loading state will show on the icon. Otherwise it will default inline with the text.

**Fixed**

- Radio and Checkbox components had minor css fixes for alignment
- Switch component does not have a random margin on the bottom
- Custom `TableRow` components that use a slot can still use the align property
