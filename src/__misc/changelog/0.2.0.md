**Breaking**

- `getFormData` and `validateInputs` are now promises.

**Added**

- `Form` now supports conditional inputs using the `hidden_if` and `hidden_unless` properties
- Stripe Elements is now built it. You pass in your own pubic key to the input, and it will collect the credit card information for you and create a stripe card token after calling `getFormData`
