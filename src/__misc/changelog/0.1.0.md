**Added**

- `Modals` now support an image
- `CardHeader` will no longer default to having a border
- `Buttons` will now default to being wide
- The svelte kit `goto` function is now added into the `configStore` and used throughout the app
- `Grid` and `GridItem` components are now available

**Fixed**

- The `goto` issue was fixed where imported `goto` functions would not work when bubbles was imported. Everything that was using `goto` was moved over to `window.location` apis and there is an issue for the svelte team to take a look at the issue: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3010
- `Pagination` will now show loading stat correctly
- `Button` now supports `prefetch` on anchor tags and automatically shows loading state when using href properties
- Removed all used css styles so the verbose builds will be much faster
- Remove more styles from the initial `app.css` that is loaded in
- Fixed spacing between two `Column100` elements on tablet sized screens
- Instead of using the window `innerWidth` value for some responsive components, this is now done through component bindings. This means elements can be nested an still responsive
