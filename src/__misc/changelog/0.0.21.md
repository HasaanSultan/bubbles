**Added**

- `setQueryParam` will remove the key from the url if passed `""` `null` or `undefined`

**Fixed**

- `Pagination` arrows would disappear on the last page
- Show the current page on pagination
- `Pagination` would stay on page 1 if query param was not in the url
- Removed default images from `Error` because they are not included in the build anyway
